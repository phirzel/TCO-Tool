    <h3>Answers</h3>
    <h5><a name="q-1">What kind of applications can I develop with JPF?</a></h5>
    <p>The short answer is: ANY type of Java application. We are currently testing JPF with
        different types of applications and some other projects are helping with this. The first
        project is a simple GUI application, developed using the Java Swing API. It is available for
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=110394">download</a> as a JPF
        demo application. The next project is a web site and services platform aimed at providing
        web developers and site maintainers (administrators, managers, content editors) with
        powerful tools to run web applications and maintain them from remote sites (with an HTML
        based UI, for example). This project is currently under serious development and will be
        publicly released soon (hopefully sometime in 2006). This project especially demonstrates
        how JPF can be very useful in J2EE applications. The last project is in the early design
        stages and is an <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt" target="_new">SWT library</a> based
        GUI application. This project is used to test how well JPF deals with native libraries.</p>
    <h5><a name="q-2">Where can I get plug-ins for JPF?</a></h5>
    <p>JPF plug-ins are dependent on the main application being developed. While with a few lines of
        code JPF can be used as an effective tool to dynamically add any Java library to any
        application, JPF itself does not provide plug-ins. It only provides the FRAMEWORK for
        developing your own. That said, you can have a look at the plug-ins that come with the demo
        application as an example to get you started.</p>
    <h5><a name="q-3">Why is JPF's plug-in manifest format different from the one used by
        Eclipse?</a></h5>
    <p>Your right! Making the JPF plug-in manifest compatible with Eclipse's would be convenient
        from a developers point of view. But unfortunately it is not so easy to implement :( The
        Eclipse team is moving very fast and it seems that they are moving to a completely OSGI
        plug-in model and making "XML based" plug-ins deprecated.</p>
    <p>We like the original idea as it is simple and easy to understand. JPF has added several
        things to Eclipse's plug-in concept to make it as open for extensions as possible. All
        manifest related APIs exist as a set of interfaces and can be implemented by custom code.
        JPF believes that it is possible to develop an Eclipse-compatible manifest implementation
        and provide it as an additional module.</p>
    <h5><a name="q-4">Why isn't there a UI provided for plug-in management?</a></h5>
    <p>The UI is out of the framework scope. That is up to the applications that use JPF. JPF
        provides full information about plug-ins and runtime resources, to support application
        logic. Nevertheless, it may be possible that some functions, related to plug-in management,
        will be implemented as "tools" and be added to the JPF distribution package.</p>
    <h5><a name="q-5">What are the system requirements and dependencies for JPF?</a></h5>
    <p>JPF requires a Java 1.3 compatible VM. It also uses the <a
            href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/" target="_new">Jakarta Commons-logging
        library</a> (included in the distribution package).</p>
    <h5><a name="q-6">Is there a way of hot-deploying plug-ins?</a></h5>
    <p>It is possible from version 0.4 and up! To register/deregister plug-ins while the application
        is running, use <a
                href="api/org/java/plugin/PluginManager.html#publishPlugins(org.java.plugin.PluginManager.PluginLocation[])">publishPlugins</a>
        method in the <a href="api/org/java/plugin/PluginManager.html">PluginManager</a> class or <a
                href="api/org/java/plugin/registry/PluginRegistry.html#register(java.net.URL[])">register()</a>
        and
        <a href="api/org/java/plugin/registry/PluginRegistry.html#unregister(java.lang.String[])">unregister()</a>
        methods in the <a href="api/org/java/plugin/registry/PluginRegistry.html">PluginRegistry</a>
        interface. To activate/deactivate registered plug-ins use the <a
                href="api/org/java/plugin/PluginManager.html#activatePlugin(java.lang.String)">activatePlugin()</a>
        and <a href="api/org/java/plugin/PluginManager.html#deactivatePlugin(java.lang.String)">deactivatePlugin()</a>
        methods in <a href="api/org/java/plugin/PluginManager.html">PluginManager</a> class.</p>
    <p>Note though that correct working of "hot deploy" functionality is dependent on cooperation
        between JPF and all plug-ins. In general, it is impossible to "unload" any Java class being
        used by at least one other "active" class. So plug-in developers need to keep in mind this
        aspect of Java class loading when developing plug-ins. The Framework provides and handles
        all required "services" to correctly "initialize" and "un-initialize" plug-in classes as
        well as to inform them about any changes to the plug-in manager and registry.</p>
    <h5><a name="q-7">Is it possible to package JPF plug-in into a single JAR file?</a></h5>
    <p>This is possible and not as difficult as it may seem. It can be done using the standard Java
        feature - "JAR URL" handler. Developers construct URL's that point to resources within a JAR
        file.</p>
    <p>Note that not any plug-in can be packaged in such a way if you are using <a
            href="api/org/java/plugin/standard/StandardPathResolver.html">standard path resolver</a>.
        The exceptions are plug-ins that contain other JAR's as libraries or native code libraries.
    </p>
    <p>Starting from version 0.8 the "single file plug-ins" are fully supported by the various JPF
        tools. There is also a <a href="tools.html#singleFilePlugin">special Ant task</a> to help
        building this type of plug-in and the <a href="boot.html">JPF Boot Library</a> was designed
        to support loading such plug-ins. If you need to load plug-ins manually (not using JPF Boot
        library) you may find it useful to use <a
                href="api/org/java/plugin/standard/StandardPluginLocation.html">standard plug-in
            location</a> implementation, it knows how to handle ZIP file or "plain folder style"
        plug-ins. Finally the <a href="api/org/java/plugin/standard/ShadingPathResolver.html">special
            path resolver</a> knows how to handle JAR'ed plug-ins even if they contain other JAR
        files or native libraries.</p>
    <h5><a name="q-8">What is it useful to know about plug-ins and classloaders?</a></h5>
    <p>Generally speaking plug-in developers usually don't care how plug-ins management and
        classloading work. This might be useful to know for application core developers - those who
        implement base logic and core plug-ins.</p>
    <p>JPF introduces concept of plug-ins and main part of this concept is classloaders isolation -
        each plug-in has it's own associated <a href="api/org/java/plugin/PluginClassLoader.html">classloader</a>
        that is responsible for managing resources of the plug-in (classes and other files).
        Plug-in's classloaders are organized in graph hierarchy that reflects dependencies between
        corresponding plug-ins.</p>
    <p>The relations in classloaders hierarchy are used to delegate resource lookup requests from
        descendant classloader to ancestor one: first trying to load resource with current (this)
        classloader, next with ancestors and next with descendants (see reverse lookup mechanism
        bellow).</p>
    <p>Java classloader API introduces another, it's own classloaders hierarchy - every classloader
        should have parent except <code>bootstrap</code> classloader that is root of this hierarchy.
        All plug-ins in JPF have <code>system</code> classloader as parent in Java API. This is the
        classloader that reflect your application CLASSPATH variable. By default, delegation in this
        hierarchy organized according to Java Language Specification - delegate loading request to
        parent classloader first and if this fails, try to load resource with this classloader using
        JPF hierarchy logic as described above. With special configuration parameter (see <code>probeParentLoaderLast</code>
        parameter on <a href="config.html">configuration reference</a> page) JPF allows to reverse
        this delegation logic: try to load resource with this classloader first and if fails
        delegate to parent.</p>
    <p>Another useful feature of JPF classloading is "reverse lookup". Describing inter plug-ins
        dependencies in prerequisites section of manifest (see <a href="dtd.html">manifest DTD</a>
        for details) you may specify that your plug-in "pluginB" depends on "pluginA" allowing
        "reverse lookup". What this mark will affect on? When classloader of "pluginA" will search
        for a resource, it will not only delegate loading request to parent classloader as described
        above but also try classloader of "pluginB" and all "reverse lookup" plug-ins ("children"
        classloaders). This trick allows creating plug-ins that can see classes not only in it's own
        libraries but in any depending plug-in also.</p>
    <p>For those who want to deep into classloading in Java it is recommended to look through the
        following resources:</p>
