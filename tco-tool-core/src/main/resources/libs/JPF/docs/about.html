    <h1>JPF System Overview</h1>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The JPF framework is based around the concept of "plug-ins". A plug-in is a structured
        component that contributes code and resources to the system and describes them in a
        structured way. These plug-ins can further define <b>extension points</b>, well-defined
        method hooks that can be extended by other plug-ins. When one plug-in provides an
        implementation of an extension point defined by another plug-in, we say that it adds an <b>extension</b>
        to the system. This approach allows developers using JPF to build highly modular and easily
        extendible applications.</p>
    <h3>Framework Structure</h3>
    <p>All required information about a plug-in is defined in the plug-in manifest. Depending on the
        <a href="api/org/java/plugin//PluginRegistry.html">PluginRegistry</a>, this may be any
        structured data that exists at some URL. JPF provides a default XML-based manifest
        implementation. The format of this XML document is defined by the JPF <a href="dtd.html">plug-in
            DTD</a>. It is very important to include as much information about a plug-in in its
        manifest as possible. This is because the JPF framework uses this information to check
        plug-in consistency, whether plug-in dependencies (relationships between plug-ins) are
        satisfied (including version compatibility check) and that all declared resources are
        available. JPF also checks that all provided extensions have been declared with the required
        parameters.</p>
    <p>The high-level structure of framework can be represented by this diagram:</p>
    <p><img src="resources/images/jpf-diagram.png" width="500" height="292" border="0"
            alt="JPF High-level Structure Diagram" title="JPF High-level Structure Diagram"/></p>
    <p>The diagram shows the three major parts of JPF:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="api/org/java/plugin/registry/PluginRegistry.html">PluginRegistry</a> - the
            storage repository for meta-information about all discovered plug-ins
        </li>
        <li><a href="api/org/java/plugin/PathResolver.html">PathResolver</a> - the component
            responsible for finding the physical lcation of all discovered resources
        </li>
        <li><a href="api/org/java/plugin/PluginManager.html">PluginManager</a> - the framework
            runtime that loads and activates the plug-ins
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="api/org/java/plugin/registry/PluginRegistry.html">PluginRegistry</a> is a set of
        interfaces that abstract meta-information about plug-ins and plug-in fragments. The
        framework provides <strong>default implementations</strong> of these interfaces based on XML
        plug-in manifests mentioned earlier (<a href="dtd.html">plug-in DTD</a>). The general rule
        here is that a manifest should be registered with the <a
                href="api/org/java/plugin/registry/PluginRegistry.html">PluginRegistry</a> for every
        plug-in and plug-in fragment.</p>
    <p>The framework also provides a <a
            href="api/org/java/plugin/standard/StandardPathResolver.html">default implementation</a>
        of <a href="api/org/java/plugin/PathResolver.html">PathResolver</a>, which simply maps
        manifest locations to the context ("home") folder of their corresponding plug-ins. A <a
                href="api/org/java/plugin/standard/ShadingPathResolver.html">special
            implementation</a> of <a href="api/org/java/plugin/PathResolver.html">PathResolver</a>
        is also available that makes "shadow copies" of plug-in resources before resolving paths to
        them. This helps avoid locking of local resources and running native code from remote
        locations.</p>
    <p>Bringing these interfaces together is <a href="api/org/java/plugin/PluginManager.html">PluginManager</a>.
        You can access an instance of the "standard", or default, <a
                href="api/org/java/plugin/PluginManager.html">PluginManager</a> by just one <a
                href="api/org/java/plugin/ObjectFactory.html#createManager()">method call</a>. This
        makes using JPF very simple in most situations.</p>
    <h3>Plug-in manifest</h3>
    <p>If you are using <a href="api/org/java/plugin/registry/xml/package-summary.html">the default
        XML based implementation</a> of <a href="api/org/java/plugin/registry/PluginRegistry.html">PluginRegistry</a>
        provided by JPF, you'll need to learn the plug-in manifest syntax. It is simple and
        shouldn't be too difficult for any familiar with HTML or XML.</p>
    <p>The plug-in manifest is an XML file which contains all the information needed by the JPF
        framework about each plug-in. The XML syntax should conform to the <a href="dtd.html">plug-in
            manifest DTD</a>. Look at this file carefully, all elements are documented.</p>
    <h3>PluginRegistry</h3>
    <p><a href="api/org/java/plugin/registry/PluginRegistry.html">PluginRegistry</a> manages all
        meta-information about discovered plug-ins. In general, you may provide your own registry
        implementation, but the standard one should be enough in most cases.</p>
    <p>To make plug-in meta-data available for the application, you (as the application developer,
        but not plug-in developer) should <a
                href="api/org/java/plugin/registry/PluginRegistry.html#register(java.net.URL[])">register</a>
        their manifests with PluginRegistry. The counterpart method - <a
                href="api/org/java/plugin/registry/PluginRegistry.html#unregister(java.lang.String[])">unregister()</a>
        is used to "remove" plug-in meta-data from the registry. To make plug-ins available for
        activation, use <a
                href="api/org/java/plugin/PluginManager.html#publishPlugins(org.java.plugin.PluginManager.PluginLocation[])">publishPlugins()</a>
        method (about <a href="api/org/java/plugin/PluginManager.html">PluginManager</a> class see
        bellow). Note that all mentioned methods may be called not only during the application start
        up phase but in also at runtime. This allows application developers to implement "hot"
        plug-in deployment functionality.</p>
    <h3>PluginManager</h3>
    <p><a href="api/org/java/plugin/PluginManager.html">PluginManager</a> is the <b>runtime
        system</b> of the Framework. The main responsibility of the manager is to activate (load
        plug-in code and call the plug-in initializer class) plug-ins upon client code requests and
        manage inter plug-in dependencies. Usually, programmers shouldn't care about plug-in
        activation, this is done automatically when the plug-in code is first called. It is also
        possible to "deactivate" plug-ins during the life of the application. This feature may help
        to reduce application resources requirements. For complex usage scenarios it is possible to
        disable/enable plug-ins. A plug-in that is marked as disabled can't be activated with <a
                href="api/org/java/plugin/PluginManager.html">PluginManager</a> (but it's meta-data
        remains available from the PluginRegistry).</p>
    <h3>Object factory</h3>
    <p>The <a href="api/org/java/plugin/ObjectFactory.html">ObjectFactory</a> class allows
        application developers to easily create base JPF objects: <a
                href="api/org/java/plugin/registry/PluginRegistry.html">PluginRegistry</a>, <a
                href="api/org/java/plugin/PluginManager.html">PluginManager</a> and <a
                href="api/org/java/plugin/PathResolver.html">PathResolver</a>. It uses a simple and
        efficient discovery algorithm to find the available implementations of the main framework
        classes. It is possible to provide your own "vision" of all aspects of the Framework: you
        may write your own registry and manager and that will be used by JPF.</p>
    <h3>Usage scenario</h3>
    <p>A typical JPF-based application may consist of a small <b>boot launcher</b>, which
        initializes the registry, instanciates <a href="api/org/java/plugin/PluginManager.html">PluginManager</a>
        and activates <b>the main plug-in</b> by calling some of it's methods (Or you can use <a
                href="boot.html">the JPF Boot Library</a> provided by JPF to greatly simplify this
        task). From this point on the flow of control remains within the registered plug-in code.
        This allows the development of applications of any kind, not only GUI applications, but also
        J2EE applications, command line utilities and more.</p>
    <p>See the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=110394">demo
        application</a> source code for an example on how to build an application with JPF. You can
        also go through the <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a>, that explains the internals of
        JPF-Demo application.</p>
