The file "TCO-Model.uml" contains an UML-Classdiagram of the genericmodel classes designed for the TCO-Tool.
It can be opened by "www.umleditor.org" (UML/INTERLIS-Editor). The File "softenvironment.ili" 
is an import file to extend persistent reusable classes for NLS-Support etc. 
The genericmodel classes in "org.tcotool.genericmodel" are generated out of this UML-Repository, therefore they are always accurate and complete!

For those not willing to install UML/INTERLIS-Editor, the following diagrams represent hardcopied subsets:
- PackageDependencies.png	(dependencies of all packages used to build the project)
- DataModel.png			(all genericmodel-classes in detail)
- ObjectTree.png		(most relevant TCO-"containers" in overview)

Tco_Tool_DRAFT_ONLY.xsd is a generated xsd-schema (also by UML/INTERLIS-Editor) corresponding to the data-genericmodel.
Please, be aware it is not yet complete nor will it valdiate correctly against an XML-instance saved by TCO-Tool.
